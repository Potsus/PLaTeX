it's going to make it a lot easier to understand

use objects for data but arrays for fast lookups

fuck no i was right
arrays are dozen's to hundreds of times faster than objects
objects are more extensible however...
objects might be better for the kind of analasys that i'm working on, albiet vastly slower

objects would be much better for what i'm talking about
rather than defining complicated loops i could define a general object with a parse method and attributes
after i've assigned semantic values to the latex i could iterate through and call their parse methods
this would generally involve searching the semantic representation and stealing values and marking things as used

methods:
get contents
parse
mark used

objects are too slow so i'll be using switch statements with code for 

i can still use arrays for indexes and keep it fast that way
arrays should also be used for the key since it's much faster there

splicing into the middle of an array is slow as shit

a little note, 
apparently while loops are much faster in reverse
