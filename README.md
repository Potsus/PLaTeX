# PLaTeX
A LaTeX parser that converts equations written in LaTeX to a format digestible by the SAGE python package. 
The initial version has tables for converting LaTeX to Python that could be swapped out for another language. Updates will seperate this out into another file for ease of use.

#### Getting Started:
Add the platex.js file to your project and the parseLatex() function will be available to you.
